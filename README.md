# COVID-19 Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data including cases, deaths, and vaccinations from various countries and continents. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on datasets obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and conducted in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The dataset is divided into two tables named `CovidDeaths$` and `CovidVaccinations$`.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), a reputable platform that provides comprehensive COVID-19 data. The dataset is divided into two tables:
- `CovidDeaths$`: Contains information about COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- `CovidVaccinations$`: Provides data on COVID-19 vaccinations.

## Queries and Analysis

1. **Basic Analysis Queries**:
   - Various SQL queries are employed to extract and analyze data including total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and infection rates.

2. **Continent-wise Analysis**:
   - Analysis is broken down by continent to understand regional trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

3. **Vaccination Impact Analysis**:
   - Queries examine the impact of vaccinations on COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

4. **Effectiveness of Vaccination**:
   - The effectiveness of vaccinations is evaluated by analyzing trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates over time.

5. **Top Locations with Highest Vaccination Rates**:
   - Identifies the top locations with the highest vaccination rates to assess the success of vaccination campaigns.

## Results and Visualizations

The analysis results provide insights into various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
- Regional disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
- Trends in vaccination rates over time.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis or perform further queries:
1. Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).
2. Import the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3. Execute the provided SQL queries in SSMS.
4. Analyze the results and adapt the queries as needed for specific analysis requirements.
